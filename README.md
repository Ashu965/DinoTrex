# DinoTrex
Dino Trex Game developed using Android Jetpack Compose.

It is simple Android game , similar to Chrome's Dino Game.
Tapping the dinosaur launches the game in which the player controls a running dinosaur by tapping the screen 
to avoid obstacles, including cacti and pterodactyls.

Some of the Core topics that I learnt during this Project are - 

•	Creating Layout using Android Jetpack Compose

•	Creating Animations using Android Jetpack Compose

•	Data Persistence

•	Using Sound in Games

•	Using States in Jetpack compose
